# This is a prototype Makefile. Modify it according to your needs.
# You should at least check the settings for
# DEVICE ....... The AVR device you compile for
# CLOCK ........ Target AVR clock rate in Hertz
# OBJECTS ...... The object files created from your source files. This list is
#                usually the same as the list of source files with suffix ".o".
# PROGRAMMER ... Options to avrdude which define the hardware you use for
#                uploading to the AVR and the interface where this hardware
#                is connected.
# FUSES ........ Parameters for avrdude to flash the fuses appropriately.

DEVICE     = attiny13
CLOCK      = 9600000 # While attiny13 is 10mhz, this is more accurate to specs.
# PROGRAMMER = -c avr910 -P /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART -C /Users/alex/etc/avrdude.conf
PROGRAMMER = -c usbasp -v
OBJECTS    = firefly.o
# Fuses: internal oscilator, no prescale
FUSES      =  -U hfuse:w:0xFF:m -U lfuse:w:0x79:m

# Tune the lines below only if you know what you are doing:
